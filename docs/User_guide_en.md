# Khamari: The Digital Heart of Your Farm 🌾

Welcome to the official guide for **Khamari**—an integrated farm management system designed to bring the power of the cloud to the soil of India.

This guide isn't just a manual; it's the story of how **Laxmi**, a modern farmer, uses Khamari to manage her integrated farm with precision, clarity, and ease.

## 📖 The Story: A Day in the Life of a Khamari Farmer

### Chapter 1: The New Identity (Farm Setup & Registration)
Laxmi used to worry that her farm lacked a professional identity. When she first opened Khamari, she was greeted in both **Odia and English**. She signed in securely with her **Google account**—no new passwords to remember.

She was prompted to set up her **Farm Profile**. She entered "Laxmi’s Green Haven" and a tagline that resonates with her soul: *“ଚାଷର ସାରଥି ଖମାରର ଉନ୍ନତି” (The charioteer of farming, the progress of the farm)*. She even picked a logo from her gallery, which the app automatically resized and synced to the cloud. Now, every staff member and family member she invites sees the same beautiful branding.

### Chapter 2: The Command Center (Dashboard)
Every morning, Laxmi checks her **Dashboard**. It’s her "Bird’s Eye View." At a glance, she sees:
*   **Today's Yield:** How many liters of milk were produced this morning.
*   **Finance Status:** A quick summary of her income vs. expenses for the month.
*   **Pending Activities:** What needs to be done today? Are the cows due for vaccination? Is it time to water the mushroom beds?

The Dashboard ensures Laxmi is never reactive; she is always ahead of her farm's needs.

### Chapter 3: The Living Records (Livestock, Plants & Allied)
Khamari is "Integrated," just like Laxmi's farm. She tracks three main pillars:

1.  **Livestock (ପଶୁପାଳନ):** Laxmi maintains detailed digital cards for her **Cows, Sheep, and Poultry**. She records their breed, health status, and even their lineage (Who is the mother of this calf?). If she adds a new cow similar to an existing one, she simply uses the **Clone Record** feature to save time.
2.  **Plants (ଉଦ୍ଭିଦ):** From field crops to her fruit orchard (Horticulture) and timber trees (Plantation), Laxmi knows exactly when she planted what and where.
3.  **Allied Farming (ସହଯୋଗୀ ଚାଷ):** Laxmi’s farm is diverse. She uses Khamari to track her **Mushroom batches (Fungiculture)** and **Beehives (Apiculture)**. She even manages her **Vermicompost units**, ensuring nothing on the farm goes to waste.

### Chapter 4: The Team (Staff Management & Labor)
Laxmi doesn't work alone. She has a team of dedicated workers. In the **Staff Management** section, she keeps a directory of her team.
*   **Work Logs:** Every evening, she logs the hours her staff worked. 
*   **Labor Costs:** The app automatically calculates the labor cost based on their hourly rates, linking these costs directly to her farm's financial reports.

### Chapter 5: The Transparent Ledger (Expense Tracking)
Finance used to be a headache of lost receipts. Now, every time Laxmi buys feed or sells milk, she adds a **Transaction**.
*   **Categorization:** She tags expenses to specific "Heads" like *Feed, Medicine, or Equipment*.
*   **Multiple Accounts:** She tracks whether the money came from her **Cash box, Bank account, or UPI**.
*   **The Ledger:** A chronological history of every rupee that enters or leaves the farm.

### Chapter 6: Knowledge is Power (Reports)
At the end of the month, Laxmi generates **Reports**.
*   **Balance Sheet:** She sees exactly which division (Livestock vs. Crops) is most profitable.
*   **Head-wise Summary:** She realizes she is spending too much on a specific type of fertilizer and decides to switch to her own organic inputs.
Khamari doesn't just store data; it provides **insights** that help Laxmi grow her business.

### Chapter 7: Security & Sharing (Export, Import & Multi-User)
Laxmi wanted her brother to help manage the farm from the city. She went to **Member Management** and simply added her brother's email. When her brother logged in, "Laxmi’s Green Haven" appeared on her screen instantly.

And for peace of mind? Laxmi uses the **Export/Import** feature. With one tap, she generates a JSON backup of her entire farm data and saves it to her Google Drive. Her data is as safe as her land.
