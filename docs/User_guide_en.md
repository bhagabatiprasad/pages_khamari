# Khamari: The Digital Heart of Your Farm 🌾

Welcome to the official guide for **Khamari**—an integrated farm management system designed to bring the power of the cloud to the soil of India.

This guide isn't just a manual; it's the story of how **Laxmi**, a modern farmer, uses Khamari to manage his integrated farm with precision, clarity, and ease.

## 📖 The Story: A Day in the Life of a Khamari Farmer

### Chapter 1: The New Identity (Farm Setup & Registration)
Laxmi used to worry that his farm lacked a professional identity. When he first opened Khamari, he was greeted in both **Odia and English**. He signed in securely with his **Google account**—no new passwords to remember.

He was prompted to set up his **Farm Profile**. He entered "Laxmi’s Green Haven" and a tagline that resonates with his soul: *“ଚାଷର ସାରଥି ଖମାରର ଉନ୍ନତି” (The charioteer of farming, the progress of the farm)*. He even picked a logo from his gallery, which the app automatically resized and synced to the cloud. Now, every staff member and family member he invites sees the same beautiful branding.

### Chapter 2: The Command Center (Dashboard)
Every morning, Laxmi checks his **Dashboard**. It’s his "Bird’s Eye View." At a glance, he sees:
*   **Today's Yield:** How many liters of milk were produced this morning.
*   **Finance Status:** A quick summary of his income vs. expenses for the month.
*   **Pending Activities:** What needs to be done today? Are the cows due for vaccination? Is it time to water the mushroom beds?

The Dashboard ensures Laxmi is never reactive; he is always ahead of his farm's needs.

### Chapter 3: The Living Records (Livestock, Plants & Allied)
Khamari is "Integrated," just like Laxmi's farm. He tracks three main pillars:

1.  **Livestock (ପଶୁପାଳନ):** Laxmi maintains detailed digital cards for his **Cows, Sheep, and Poultry**. He records their breed, health status, and even their lineage (Who is the mother of this calf?). If he adds a new cow similar to an existing one, he simply uses the **Clone Record** feature to save time.
2.  **Plants (ଉଦ୍ଭିଦ):** From field crops to his fruit orchard (Horticulture) and timber trees (Plantation), Laxmi knows exactly when he planted what and where.
3.  **Allied Farming (ସହଯୋଗୀ ଚାଷ):** Laxmi’s farm is diverse. He uses Khamari to track his **Mushroom batches (Fungiculture)** and **Beehives (Apiculture)**. He even manages his **Vermicompost units**, ensuring nothing on the farm goes to waste.

### Chapter 4: The Team (Staff Management & Labor)
Laxmi doesn't work alone. He has a team of dedicated workers. In the **Staff Management** section, he keeps a directory of his team.
*   **Work Logs:** Every evening, he logs the hours his staff worked. 
*   **Labor Costs:** The app automatically calculates the labor cost based on their hourly rates, linking these costs directly to his farm's financial reports.

### Chapter 5: The Transparent Ledger (Expense Tracking)
Finance used to be a headache of lost receipts. Now, every time Laxmi buys feed or sells milk, he adds a **Transaction**.
*   **Categorization:** He tags expenses to specific "Heads" like *Feed, Medicine, or Equipment*.
*   **Multiple Accounts:** He tracks whether the money came from his **Cash box, Bank account, or UPI**.
*   **The Ledger:** A chronological history of every rupee that enters or leaves the farm.

### Chapter 6: Knowledge is Power (Reports)
At the end of the month, Laxmi generates **Reports**.
*   **Balance Sheet:** He sees exactly which division (Livestock vs. Crops) is most profitable.
*   **Head-wise Summary:** He realizes he is spending too much on a specific type of fertilizer and decides to switch to his own organic inputs.
Khamari doesn't just store data; it provides **insights** that help Laxmi grow his business.

### Chapter 7: Security & Sharing (Export, Import & Multi-User)
Laxmi wanted his brother to help manage the farm from the city. He went to **Member Management** and simply added his brother's email. When his brother logged in, "Laxmi’s Green Haven" appeared on his screen instantly.

And for peace of mind? Laxmi uses the **Export/Import** feature. With one tap, he generates a JSON backup of his entire farm data and saves it to his Google Drive. His data is as safe as his land.
